# **DOCKER**
<br>

---------------------

<br>

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files.

## **HOW DOCKER WORKS?**
- Docker packages, provisions and runs containers. Container technology is available through the operating system: A container packages the application service or function with all of the libraries, configuration files, dependencies and other necessary parts and parameters to operate. Each container shares the services of one underlying operating system. Docker images contain all the dependencies needed to execute code inside a container, so containers that move between Docker environments with the same OS work with no changes.
